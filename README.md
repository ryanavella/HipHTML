# HipHTML [![](https://godoc.org/github.com/ryanavella/hiphtml?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/ryanavella/hiphtml)

HipHTML is a wrapper around golang.org/x/net/html, providing a layer of abstraction that simplifies web scraping.

At the moment, the API is *not* stable. The package is still in development and may undergo major refactoring in the near future.
